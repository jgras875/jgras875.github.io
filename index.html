        <h2>Sophomore Business Administration Major, From Menno, South Dakota.</h2>
        
         <p> I am a first year Sophomore here at Bob Jones, and have really enjoyed my stay here so far!  .</p>
         <p>
            Through daily engagement in my pursuit to get to know roughly everybody on campus, I manage to stay relatively busy. Though I run Cross Country and Track here at BJU, I spend about the same amount of time playing basketball on the outside courts, or you may see me playing ping pong downstairs (every now and then, I am running from a tragic past in which I was in the runnings for a world ping pong championship)
         </p> 
         <p>
           If I'm not on campus, I am probably at church, I attend Woodruff Road PCA, and you probably guessed where that is, Woodruff Road. One of my largest joys in attending Bob Jones is that when I was younger my dad attended seminary at GPTS, and we attended church at Woodruff Road, plenty of great memories!
             Though I am ready to go home now, this semester really has been a blast, a trip to Charleston, camping at Smokemont, NC, and even having Covid, all of these fun little adventures just added up to make for an exceptional year with the protective hand of God overseeing all of it!
